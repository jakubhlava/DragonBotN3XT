# DragonBot N3XT

My third attempt to create Discord Bot for our small server :)

Docs & more are WIP

## Basic install & run

``pip install -e .`` in root folder
``python dragonbot`` to run

don't forget to copy ``settings.default.json`` to ``settings.json`` and change database server and other settings according to your liking
